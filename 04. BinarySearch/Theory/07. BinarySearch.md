## Binary Search

- Used if array is sorted or if there is some sequence.
- Idea is to find the element, we calculate the middle element, and basis on this, we either search towards left side of the middle element or towards the right side of the element.
- TC O(logn)
- It is better than linear search which is O(n)
- Array is sorted or it must follow some sequence. Now we divide the array into two halves and compare our target element with the middle element. Now, if the target element is less than middle element, we repeat the same process for left half. If not, it is right half.

- **_Iterative Approach:_**

```
left = 0
right = len(arr)-1

while left <= right:
    mid = (left+right)//2 #solve this mathematically to understand how the equality works here
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif target < arr[mid]:
        right = mid - 1
    else:
        left = mid + 1

```

- **_Recursive Approach:_**

```
def recursive (left, right, target): #add another condition from Abdul Barri Notes.
    left = 0
    right = len(arr)-1

    while left <= right:
        if target == nums[mid]:
            return mid
        elif target <nums[mid]:
            return recursive (left, mid-1, target)
        else:
            return recursive (mid+1, right, target)

```

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

Approach: binary search as they are sorted. 
return the left element as we need the minimum 

TC: O(logn) as it is a binary search
SC: O(1) no additional space is required

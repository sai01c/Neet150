# Backtracking

Current State - 
Valid States - 

- This strategy follows Brute force approach - For any given problem, try out all posssible solutions and pick up desired solution. 
- Backtracking is used when you have multiple solutions and you want all those solutions.
- Brute Force approach finds all the possible solutions and selects desired solution per given the constraints.
- Dynamic Programming also uses Brute Force approach to find the OPTIMUM solution, either maximum or minimum.
- Backtracking also uses Brute Force approach but to find ALL the solutions.
- Solutions to the Backtracking problems can be represented as State-Space Tree.
- The constrained applied to find the solution is called Bounding function.
- Backtracking follows Depth-First Search method.
- Branch and Bound is also a Brute Force approach, which uses Breadth-First Search method.

- Series of decisions and if one decision goes wrong we want to backtrack and continue from there

1. Subsets - Add, Don't add 
2. Permutation - Traverse through the array and use set to check if elements are already used
3. Combination - Traverse through the string/array using another pointer j

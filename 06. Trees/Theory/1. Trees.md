## Trees

- Trees can be said as an extension of Linked List. acyclic, connected, undirected graph. non-linear data structure. 
- It contains root, nodes. Levels is like a floor.
- There are no cycles in a tree. Graph may contain cycles. 
- Trees are hierarchial data structures whereas linkedlist are linear data structures. 

- Height is number of edges from the root to farthest node.
- Depth is number of edges from node to root. 
- height and depth are inverse.

- Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.
- child node with same parent are called siblings. 

## Binary Tree

- Every node has at most two children- left child and right child.

1. Full Binary Tree: every node will have either 0 or 2 children
2. Complete Binary Tree: All levels should be completely filled except last. In the last level, nodes are as left as possible. 
3. Unbalanced binary tree: 
4. Perfect Binary Tree: All leaf nodes are at same level

## Time Complexity: 

- Insertion: O(n) O(logn) // worst case, average case
- Deletion: O(n) O(logn)
- Searching O(n) O(logn)
- Accessing O(n) O(logn)


- depth of a balanced binary tree is O(log n)
- worst case they can be single straight line so this is the TC for this particular case

## Asymptotic Notation-

- O(n) upper bound, omega is lower bound, theta is average bound.
- **_They do not represent the best, worst, average case. They are just bounds._**
- **_We can use any notation for best, worst and average case's._**

### Big-Oh:

- f(n) is O of g(n) when `0 <= f(n) <= c * g(n)` for all n>0.

### Omega

- f(n) is omega of g(n) when `f(n) >= c * g(n) >= 0` for all n>0.

### Theta

- f(n) is theta of g(n) if `c1 * g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 * g(n)`

### Examples-

1. f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 5 <= 10n^2 = O(n^2)

1. f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 5 >= 1n^2 = omega(n^2)

1. f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 5 >= 1n^2 and <= 10n^2 = theta(n^2).

1. f(n^2 + logn) <= n^2 = O(n^2)

### Properties of Asymptotic Notation:

1. f(n) is O(g(n)) then (k f(n)) is also O(g(n)) #k is constant. #same for omega and theta.
2. f(n) is O(f(n)) #Reflexive property
3. f(n) is O(g(n)) and g(n) is O(h(n)) then f(n) is O(h(n)). #transitive property
4. f(n) is theta of (g(n)) then g(n) is theta of f(n) #symmetric property
5. f(n) is o(g(n)) and u(n) is O(v(n)) then f(n).u(n) is O(g(n).v(n))

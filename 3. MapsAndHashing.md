### Hashing

- Constant time search/lookup.
- value => hash-value
- we can search for the value in linear time by indexing using the hash-value.

### Collisions

- Same hash-value for 2 different input values.

1. Change the hash-function
2. Store multiple hash-values for a single input value using buckets and create new hash-function for each bucket.

- Both approaches are not ideal.
- Load Factor = number of inputs/ number of buckets.

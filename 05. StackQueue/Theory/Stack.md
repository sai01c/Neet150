## Stack

- Collection of elements with two principles- push and pop.
- Push is to add element.
- Pop is to remove the element from the top.
- **_Last in First Out LIFO_** Most recently addded element is removed first.

### Time  Complexity
- Insertion O(1)
- Deletion O(1)
- top O(1)
- isEmpty O(1)
- size O(1)
- isFull O(1)
- Search O(n)
- Access O(1)

- Use stacks when you want to compare one element with other element. Adding and deleting is also O(1) we can use for this reason
- Stack OverFlow is occured when you are pushing an element to already full stack.

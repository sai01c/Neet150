## Use DFS

- Refer to Course schedule problem 
- Diff b/w directed and undirected is we add a extra condition in directed to check if parent == nei

```

def dfs(node):
    if node in visit:  # cycle exists
        return False
    if node not in dic or dic[node] == []:  
        # no prereq for this course
        return True
    # before checking for neighbors we need to add this to set to check for cycle
    visit.add(node)
    for nei in dic[node]:
        if not dfs(nei):
            return False
    visit.remove(node) #remove from cycle as this is already done
    dic[node] = [] #this is for elimination TLE. 
    
    return True

for i in range(1, n+1):
    if not dfs(i):
        return False
return True

```

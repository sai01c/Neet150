## Depth First Search

- First, goes into the depth for each node and then recursively repeats the same process for other nodes. 

- TC: O(V + E)

Applications:
- Finding a path between two specified nodes, u and v, of an unweighted graph.
- Finding a path between two specified nodes, u and v, of a weighted graph.
- Finding whether a graph is connected or not.
- Computing the spanning tree of a connected graph

## Iterative

```
def dfs_iterating(graph, s):
    # set is used to mark visited vertices
    visited = set()

    # create a stack for DFS
    stack = []

    # Push vertex s to the stack
    stack.append(s)

    while stack:
        current_vertex = stack.pop()

        # Stack may contain same vertex twice. So
        # we need to print the popped item only
        # if it is not visited.
        if current_vertex not in visited:
            print(current_vertex)
            visited.add(current_vertex)

        # Get all adjacent vertices of current_vertex
        # If an adjacent has not been visited, then push it to stack
        for v in graph[current_vertex]:
            if v not in visited:
                stack.append(v)
```
                
Input (graph 1): graph = [[1,2], [0,2,4], [0,1,3], [2], [1]], s = 0
Output: 0 1 2 3 4 (or 0 2 3 1 4)

## Recursive

```
def dfs_recur(graph, start):
    visit = set()
    def recur(vertex):
        print(vertex)
        visit.add(vertex)

        for v in graph(vertex):
            if v not in visit:
                recur(v)
    recur(start)
```

- Recursive is very straighforward.

## Breadth First Search

- Graph traversal algorithm where we travel level wise. We move horizontally and complete the layer and move to the next layer. 

- Time Complexity: O(V + E)

- Finding all connected components in a graph G.
- Finding all nodes within an individual connected component
- Finding the shortest path between two nodes, u and v, of an unweighted graph.

Input (graph 1): graph = [[1,2], [0,2,4], [0,1,3], [2], [1]], s = 0
Output: 0 1 2 4 3


from collections import deque

# graph: List[List[int]]
# s: start vertex
def bfs(graph, s):
    # set is used to mark visited vertices
    visited = set()
    
    # create a queue for BFS 
    queue = deque()
    
    # Mark the start vertex as visited and enqueue it
    visited.add(s)
    queue.append(s)

    while queue:
        current_vertex = queue.popleft() 
        #remember popleft is diff from pop
        print(current_vertex)

        # Get all adjacent vertices of current_vertex 
        # If a adjacent has not been visited, then mark it 
        # visited and enqueue it
        
        for v in graph[current_vertex]:
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                queue.append(v) #remember append not appendleft

## Djikstra

- Minimization, Optimization problem- Greedy Method. 
- Both directed or undirected graph. 
- Once you have selected shortest path from a to b, now check if there exists any shortest path from b to other vertices. 
- First, we pick a node 'a' and check the nodes which are connected to initial node a. 
- Now, we calculate the distance from a to the connected nodes. Unconnected means infinity. 
- Repeat the same process by choosing the minimum weight node each iteration. 
- It can work on undirected graphs as well. We can convert the undirected edge to double edge with equal weight. 

Disadvantages: 
- Does not work on negative edges. 

- Tc: O(n^2) or O(v^2)

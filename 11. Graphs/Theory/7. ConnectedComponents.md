## Connected Components

- This is not strongly connected.
- This is just for connected component. 
- We can use dfs or bfs

- Initialize all vertices as not visited.
- Do following for every vertex 'v'.
-   If 'v' is not visited before, call DFS(v)
-   Print new line character

```
def dfs(graph, start, visit, temp):
    visit[start] = True
    temp.append(start)

    for v in graph[start]:
        if visit[v] == False:
            temp = dfs(graph, v, visit, temp)
    return temp

def scc():
    visited = []
    res = []
    for i in range(len(graph)):
        visited.append(False)

    for v in range(len(graph)):
        if visited[v] == False:
            temp = []
            res.append(dfs(graph, v, visited, temp))

    return res
```

## Number of connected componenets

```
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, isConnected: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        visit = set()
        res = 0
        def dfs(node):
            if node in visit:
                return 
            visit.add(node)
            for i in range(len(isConnected[node-1])): #this is tricy, write to undertand format
                if isConnected[node-1][i] == 1: #we have an edge for these nodes
                    dfs(i+1) 
        #from one node we get all the connected nodes to the set.     
        for node in range(1, len(isConnected) + 1):
            if node not in visit: #nodes not in visit means not connected
                dfs(node)
                res += 1
                
        return res
            
        
```

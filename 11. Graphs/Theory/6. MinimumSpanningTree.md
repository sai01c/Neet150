## Minimum Spanning Tree:

- subset graph with n vertices and n-1 edges. 
- As it is a tree, there should not be any cycle. 
- Subgraph where no cycle exists. More than one mst possible. Mst with the min weight. 
- There is no MST for unconnected graph

## Prim's MST algorithm: 

- First, select the min weight edge. 
- Next, among the connected edges to the min edge, select the min edge. Repeat the process.
- TC: O(n^2)

## Kruskal MST algorithm:

- Always select the min edge irrespective of its connections. 
- O(n^2) but if we use min-heap it can be n logn
- For unconnected graphs we can find MST for individual components using Kruskal algo.

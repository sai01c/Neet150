## Using BFS

- We use a parent array to keep track of the parent vertex for a vertex so that we do not consider the visited parent as a cycle.

- For any vertex u, if there's adjancent vertex v which is already visited and parent is not v. Then we can think as a cycle. 

``` 

def bfs(graph, start):

    visit = set()
    q = collections.deque()
    parent = [-1] * len(graph)

    visit.add(start)
    q.append(start)

    while q:
        curr = q.popleft()
        print(curr)

        for v in graph[curr]:
            if curr not in visit:
                visit.add(curr)
                q.append(curr)
                parent[v] = cur
            
            elif parent[curr] != v:
                return True
    
    return False

```

## Using DFS  

- This is Valid Graph Tree question. Also refer to redundant connection.
- Diff b/w directed and undirected is we add a extra condition in directed to check if parent == nei


```
def graphValidTree(n, edges):
    dic = defaultdict(list)
    for k, v in edges:
        dic[k].append(v)
        dic[v].append(k)

    print(dic)
    visit = set()
    def dfs(node, parent):
        if node in visit:
            return False
        visit.add(node)
        for val in dic[node]:
            if val == parent:
                continue
            if not dfs(val, node):
                return False
        
        return True
    
    return dfs(0, -1) and len(visit) == n

```
